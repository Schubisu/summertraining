Before you start
=================

The motto of `dgplug <https://dgplug.org>`_ is "Learn yourself and teach
others". The summer training effort is a huge part of this. We try to learn
together and help each other. Before you jump into this, there are a few small
things one should know.

How to ask for help?
---------------------

There will be many times in a day when you will need some help, may be to solve
a problem, or to learn a new thing. Before you go and ask for help, you should
first search for a solution. Most of the times, you will find the answer
yourself. We suggest everyone to use `DuckDuckGo <https://duckduckgo.com>`_
search engine. This particular search engine does not track you, and focused to
protect your privacy.

If you open the site for the first time, it you show you ways you can enable it
as the default search engine in your browser. That should be the first thing to
do. Go ahead, and enable DuckDuckGo as the default search engine.

There is no magic mirror!
--------------------------

If you just come online and ask help by saying "I have an error.", no one will
be able to help you. Because, we need to see the exact error you can see in
your computer. Best way to ask for help is by providing as much information as
possible along with the question. If the error message is more than 2 lines,
then one should use a pastebin server (like `Fedora modernpate service
<https://paste.fedoraproject.org/>`_) and paste the whole error message there,
and then only provide the URL to the pastebin in the question.
