Communication
=============

We use IRC as our primary communication during summer training and it also a
main communication medium for many FOSS projects.

Clients
--------

- xchat
- hexchat
- webchat
- Waartaa

Rules to follow
---------------

Always type full English words, no sms speak in any FOSS communications. That
means no more 'u' or 'r', instead type 'you' or 'are'.

Though are few sort forms which are acceptable in IRC.
