The above is the first ever IRC server (original image is from `Wikimedia Commons <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Tolsun_2.jpg>`_).

We use IRC as our primary communication medium because it works with low bandwidth.
You don't super fast internet connection to attend the summer training sessions. Also,
later when you will try to contact other communities, you will find most of them
are active on IRC.

What is a channel?
-------------------

Every IRC server has various virtual groups or rooms where people can
communicate with each other. These are known as channels. The channel names
start with *#* sign. For example, **#dgplug** is the channel name in Freenode
server for our training.
