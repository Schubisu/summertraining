IRC on the Web
==============
While a client (xchat, hexchat, etc), on any platform, is the best way to experience IRC on a daily basis, 
you can in fact use your web browser to connect to IRC!

While it might not be as comfortable as a native client, irc via a browser is actually quite full featured.

It depends on you knowing commands though, so `this page on the IRC beginner website <http://ircbeginner.com/ircinfo/ircc-commands.html>`_ will come in real handy.

So let’s start at the very beginning [#]_.

Here’s what we’d need for our summer sessions.

1. We need a browser
2. We need an username that stays the same, throughout sessions
3. We need to login to the #dgplug channel on `freenode <https://webchat.freenode.net>`_ with that username

Step 1. The Browser
-------------------
Congratulations!

You’ve already have one and are successfully connected :)

Step 2. A username for irc. 


.. [#] A very good place to start!
