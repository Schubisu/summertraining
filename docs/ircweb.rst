IRC on the Web
==============
While a client (xchat, hexchat, etc), on any platform, is the best way to experience IRC on a daily basis, 
you can in fact use your web browser to connect to IRC!

While it might not be as comfortable as a native client, irc via a browser is actually quite full featured.

It depends on you knowing commands though, so `this page on the IRC beginner website <http://ircbeginner.com/ircinfo/ircc-commands.html>`_ will come in real handy.

So let’s start at the very beginning [#]_.

Here’s what we’d need for our summer sessions.

1. We need a browser
2. We need an username that stays the same, throughout sessions
3. We need to login to the #dgplug channel on `freenode <https://webchat.freenode.net>`_ with that username

Step 1. The Browser
-------------------
Congratulations!

You’ve already have one and are successfully connected, if you :)

Step 2. A username for IRC.
---------------------------

Let’s mosey over to the `freenode website <https://webchat.freenode.net>`_

Login with the username you want like I’ve done here.

Ignore the channel and auth options for now.  

Just clear the I am not a robot test

And you should enter the world of irc!

There’ll be a lot of stuff that’ll end with a screen like this.

You’ll obviously have figured out that the little white box at the bottom is where you type in your messages and commands. Also note the tab that says status above. You’ll want to click this tab before typing in sensitive IRC commands (as you will do shortly). You’ll see more tabs at the top as you join channels later and you’ll use the tabs to switch between them.

You in with your username? Good. Now let’s register it so that we can always have the same one.

In this instance, my username is mariojason. You will use yours.
