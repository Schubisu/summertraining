Good practices
===============

Here are a few suggestions on good practices while using computers daily life.
In this guide we mentioned a few major habits or tools., and then we also
links to documents to learn more about those habits or tools.

Use strong and unique passwords
-------------------------------

We should use unique passwords in different places. Otherwise, if someone can
get hold of one of your password, they can break into other sites/places with
the same password. We suggest using `diceware

learn more, please read `this blog post

Use password managers
-----------------------

Password managers will help you to store all of those long passphrases in one
place. Learn from this guide about `password managers

`KeePassXC <https://medium.com/@mshelton/keypass-for-beginners-dc8adfcdad54>`_ is a good option on desktop.


Do not keep the computer unlocked
----------------------------------

If you are not in front of the computer, then always lock the screen. Do not
keep the computer unlocked, let it be inside your house, or in your hostel, or
in anywhere else. This is again an habit, and it takes time to make this
habit. Having the computer always password protected will make sure that any
person can not directly access your computer even if you are not front of the
computer for few minutes.

Cover up your webcam
---------------------

Over the last few years it became very well known that big agencies and
criminals can access people's webcams and record without anyone knowing.
Covering up your laptop webcam will protect you at one level against these
criminal activities. Here is `story
<http://thehill.com/policy/national-security/295933-fbi-director-cover-up-your-webcam>`_
which talks about how the FBI director also puts up a tape on his laptop's
webcam.

Keep your machine updated
--------------------------

Always keep all the software updated. There are always new security updates
available, and we should install them as soon as possible. This is true not
only for normal computers, but, also for mobile phones and any other modern
smart home internet things.
